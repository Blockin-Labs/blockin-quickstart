         * 5) Any additional verification checks specified in the verifyChallenge options
         * 
         * Below, you can add any other validity checks that you wish to add.
         *      -You can use chainDriver.functionName where functionName is in the ChainDriver interface.
         *      -You can also use the helper functions exported from Blockin to manipulate and parse challenges
         * For both of the above, check out the Blockin documentation.
         * 
         * Once everything is validated and verified, you can add the logic below to grant the user access to your
         * resource. This can be via any method of your choice, such as:
         *      -JWTs
